# Chumber 🐱

A *truly* essential browser extension that brings you wisdom, joy, and mild confusion — all delivered by a cat.

## 😺 What Is Chumber?

**Chumber** is a funny little browser extension that displays a random quote every time you open the popup. Sometimes motivating. Sometimes unhinged. Always cat-approved.

Whether you're debugging your 14th JavaScript error or procrastinating your 3rd deadline of the day, Chumber is here to offer guidance. Or chaos.

## ✨ Features

* 🐈 **Random quotes** — philosophical, absurd, or both.
* 🎨 **Cute cat icon** — because productivity is overrated.
* ⚡ **Instant inspiration** — one click, many possibilities.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gavinpetruzzi/chumber.git
   ```
2. Open **Chrome** → navigate to **chrome://extensions**.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `chumber` folder.
5. Enjoy the chaos.

## 🧠 How It Works

When you click the extension:

* A popup appears.
* A cat spiritually channels a quote.
* You become stronger.

That's it.
